## Expert Survey (UC Berkeley, 2014)

- Ask 40 experts to define *"big data"*...


## Expert Survey (UC Berkeley, 2014)

- Ask 40 experts to define *"big data"*...
- ... get 40 different definitions :)


## Expert Survey (UC Berkeley, 2014)

```{r wordcloud, echo=FALSE, out.width = "90%", fig.align='center', purl=FALSE, fig.cap="Image by Jennifer Dutcher, datascience@berkeley, source: https://datascience.berkeley.edu/what-is-big-data/"}

```


## Expert Survey: Example 1

"Big Data is the result of *collecting information at its most granular level* — it’s what you get when you instrument a system and keep all of the data that your instrumentation is able to gather."

*Jon Bruner*
(Editor-at-Large, O’Reilly Media)


## Expert Survey: Example 2

"Big data is data that contains enough observations to *demand unusual handling because of its sheer size*, though what is unusual changes over time and varies from one discipline to another."

*Annette Greiner*<br>
(Lecturer, UC Berkeley School of Information)


## Expert Survey: Example 3

"[...] 'big data' will ultimately describe any dataset large enough to necessitate *high-level programming skill* and *statistically defensible methodologies* in order to transform the data asset into something of value."

*Reid Bryant*<br>
(Data Scientist, Brooks Bell)


## Conclusion

```{r hard, echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center', purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("../img/01_its_hard.jpeg")
```


## Conclusion

- Large amounts of data 
- Various types/formats of data
- Unusual sources
- Speed of data flow/stream
- Use programming and statistics (in a broad sense) to extract value

# Big Data in Scientific Research

## Big Data in the Sciences
- Mother nature always has provided the data, but...
     - ... instruments have gotten more precise
     - ... new measurement methods have been developed 
- Prominent examples: Astronomy, Genomics/Bioinformatics

include_graphics("../img/01_rlogo2.png")

<!-- ## Approach to Big Data Analytics -->

<!-- 1. Build on knowledge in *Applied Econometrics*. -->
<!-- 2. *Analyze the underlying problem*. -->
<!-- 3. Understand the underlying *concept*. -->
<!-- 4. *Apply* the concepts in hands-on exercises. -->

## Prerequisites?
  - Build on concepts taught in Data Analytics I (and more basic econometrics courses).
  - Brief review of concepts, but no additional introduction.

## R used in two ways

- A tool to analize problems posed by large datasets.
     - For example, memory usage (in R).
     - (Idea behind 'advanced R programming part)
- A practical tool for Big Data Analytics.

## Example
Preparations
```{r}
# read dataset into R
economics <- read.csv("../data/economics.csv")
# have a look at the data
head(economics, 2)
# create a 'large' dataset out of this
for (i in 1:3) {
     economics <- rbind(economics, economics)
}
dim(economics)

```

## Example

Compute the real personal consumption expenditures (`pce`): Divide each value of `pce` by the deflator `1.05`.

```{r}
# Naïve approach (ignorant of R)
deflator <- 1.05 # define deflator
# iterate through each observation
pce_real <- c()
n_obs <- length(economics$pce)
for (i in 1:n_obs) {
  pce_real <- c(pce_real, economics$pce[i]/deflator)
}

# look at the result
head(pce_real, 2)


```

## Example

How long does it take?

```{r}
# Naïve approach (ignorant of R)
deflator <- 1.05 # define deflator
# iterate through each observation
pce_real <- list()
n_obs <- length(economics$pce)
time_elapsed <-
     system.time(
         for (i in 1:n_obs) {
              pce_real <- c(pce_real, economics$pce[i]/deflator)
})

time_elapsed

```


## Example

Assuming a linear time algorithm ($O(n)$), we need that much time for one additional row of data: 

```{r}

time_per_row <- time_elapsed[3]/n_obs
time_per_row

```

## Example

If we deal with big data, say 100 million rows, that is

```{r}
# in seconds
(time_per_row*100^4) 
# in minutes
(time_per_row*100^4)/60 
# in hours
(time_per_row*100^4)/60^2 

```



## Example

What happens in the background?

- Evaluation/computation
- Memory allocation/deallocation


## Example

Can we improve this?

```{r}
# Improve memory allocation (still somewhat ignorant of R)
deflator <- 1.05 # define deflator
n_obs <- length(economics$pce)
pce_real <- list()
# allocate memory beforehand
# tell R how long the list will be
length(pce_real) <- n_obs


```


## Example

Can we improve this?

```{r}
# Improve memory allocation (still somewhat ignorant of R)
deflator <- 1.05 # define deflator
n_obs <- length(economics$pce)
pce_real <- list()
# allocate memory beforehand
# tell R how long the list will be
length(pce_real) <- n_obs
# iterate through each observation
time_elapsed <-
     system.time(
         for (i in 1:n_obs) {
              pce_real[[i]] <- economics$pce[i]/deflator
})

time_elapsed

```


## Example

Any improvements?

```{r}

time_per_row <- time_elapsed[3]/n_obs
time_per_row

```

## Example

```{r}
# in seconds
(time_per_row*100^4) 
# in minutes
(time_per_row*100^4)/60 
# in hours
(time_per_row*100^4)/60^2 

```

This looks much better, but we can do even better...


## Example

Can we further improve this?

```{r}
# Do it 'the R wqy'
deflator <- 1.05 # define deflator
# Exploit R's vectorization!
time_elapsed <- 
     system.time(
     pce_real <- economics$pce/deflator
          )
# same result
head(pce_real, 2)
# but much faster!
time_elapsed

time_per_row <- time_elapsed[3]/n_obs
```

## Example

In fact, `system.time()` is not precise enough to capture the time elapsed...

```{r}
# in seconds
(time_per_row*100^4) 
# in minutes
(time_per_row*100^4)/60 
# in hours
(time_per_row*100^4)/60^2 

```

## Example

Use `microbenchmark::microbenchmark()` to measure the elapsed time in microseconds (millionth of a second)

```{r}
library(microbenchmark)
# measure elapsed time in microseconds (avg.)
time_elapsed <- 
  summary(microbenchmark(pce_real <- economics$pce/deflator))$mean

# per row (in sec)
time_per_row <- (time_elapsed/n_obs)/10^6

```

## Example

Improvement with vectorization (again, assuming 100 million rows)

```{r}
# in seconds
(time_per_row*100^4) 
# in minutes
(time_per_row*100^4)/60 
# in hours
(time_per_row*100^4)/60^2 

```


## What do we learn from this?

1. How R allocates and deallocates memory can have a substantial effect on computation time.
     - (Particularly, if we deal with a large dataset!)
2. In what way the computation is implemented can matter a lot for the time elapsed.
     - (For example, loops vs. vectorization/apply)
